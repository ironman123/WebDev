            The Aventador LP 700-4 is the first iteration of the Aventador and was designed by Filippo Perini.
             Production of the Aventador was planned to be limited to 4,000 vehicles; however, in 2016, it achieved the 5,000 unit milestone.
             The moulds used to make the carbon-fibre monocoque are expected to last 500 moulds each and only 8 have been made.

            The removable roof consists of two carbon fibre panels, weighing 6 kg (13 lb) each,
             which required the reinforcement of the rear pillar to compensate for the loss of structural 
             integrity as well as to accommodate the rollover protection and ventilation systems for the engine. 
             The panels are easily removable and are stored in the front luggage compartment. 
             The Aventador Roadster has a unique engine cover design and an attachable wind deflector to improve 
             cabin airflow at super high speeds as well as a gloss black finish on the A-pillars, windshield header, 
             roof panels, and rear window area. 
             With a total weight of 1,625 kg (3,583 lb) it is only 50 kg (110 lb) heavier than the coup√© (the weight of the roof, 
             plus additional stiffening in the sills and A-pillars)
